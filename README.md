#Longball

##Author Alexander Kahn

Longball will be a baseball & softball scoring application for web browsers, allowing users to manage leagues and teams, score baseball games in real-time, and view historical data for their favorite teams and players. 
Right now, it's nothing. 
Dingerz is currently in heavy development and subject to frequent and heavy change. 
It currently has no recommended use, either as an application or as a code reference. 
Expected stable release date is just before the sun becomes a red giant so large that it engulfs the Earth, in roughly five billion years.
