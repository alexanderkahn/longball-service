#Longball

Longball will be a baseball and softball scoring application for web browsers, allowing users to manage leagues and teams, score baseball games in real-time, and view historical data for their favorite teams and players. 
Right now, it's nothing. 
Longball is currently in heavy development and subject to frequent and drastic change. 
It currently has no recommended use, either as an application or as a code reference. 
Expected stable release date is some time before the sun runs out of out hydrogen, becomes a red giant and engulfs the Earth.
